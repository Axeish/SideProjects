This is a barebones Angular JS/MEAN Stack app that I am creating as a playground for our Side Project.

I will keep experimenting on this for sometime


Changelog

06/28/2016

V1.1. Barebones app created with basic routing using routeProvider
V1.2. Changed the folder structure, will need to improve the structure
V1.3. Added an array in the homeController that contains some arbitrary products

	

V1.4. Added some images and the W3.CSS file
V1.5. Added a floating button that has 'no functionality'
V1.6. Added zoom to the images.  However, there is no angular logic backing this functionlity
	so for now, the image zoom will always display the first image
